What is it?
-----------
Small program that will biff out a quote from the TV show married with
children onto your web page.  Your web server should allow Server Side Includes.

Installing
----------
1) Compile using FPC (or use included Windows .exe)
2) Place bundy.exe in your cgi-bin directory
3) Copy the bundy quotes file into your cgi-bin dir.
4) Edit bundy.cfg to suit your system. (and copy to cgi-bin dir)

Bug reports
-----------
You can fix it yourself as the pascal source is included and it's probably
the smallest simplest program you can find.  Took me aprox 3 minutes to
write. :)
